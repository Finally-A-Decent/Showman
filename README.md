A platform generic event listener for Minecraft servers implementations.

While this project is incredibly amazing and useful in theory.
I realised while trying to implement it, that it is a **MASSIVE** project, and quite frankly I don't have time for it.
So if you want to take this base and work on it, that would be sick! But keep in mind the current framework is just me
messing around trying to find a pattern that would work. And to be honest im not sure if it would hold up down the road.

So this project is kinda at a stale state, and is gonna just be a learning project for all those who come across it or attempt to work on it.
